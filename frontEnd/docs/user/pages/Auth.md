### Auth.md

### Overview
The `Auth.js` file defines the authentication component of the application. This component handles user login and signup functionalities using form validation, state management, and context API for authentication state.

### Import Statements
```javascript
import React, { useContext, useState } from "react";
import "./Auth.css";
import Card from "../../shared/components/UIElements/Card";
import Input from "../../shared/components/FormElements/Input";
import { VALIDATOR_EMAIL, VALIDATOR_MINLENGTH, VALIDATOR_REQUIRE } from "../../shared/util/validators";
import { useForm } from "../../shared/hooks/form-hook";
import Button from "../../shared/components/FormElements/Button";
import { AuthContext } from "../../shared/context/auth-context";
```
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **useContext & useState**: Hooks for managing context and component state.
- **CSS**: Styles specific to the `Auth` component.
- **UI Components**: `Card`, `Input`, and `Button` are custom components used for structuring and styling the form.
- **Validators**: Utility functions for validating form inputs.
- **useForm Hook**: Custom hook for handling form state and input validation.
- **AuthContext**: Context API for managing authentication state across the application.

### Main Functionalities
- **Authentication Mode Toggle**: Switches between login and signup modes.
- **Form Handling**: Manages form state, input validation, and submission.
- **Context Usage**: Uses context to handle login state across the application.

### Component Logic
#### State Management
- **isLoginMode**: Manages whether the form is in login or signup mode.
- **formState**: Manages the state of form inputs and their validation.

#### Handlers
- **switchModeHandler**: Toggles between login and signup modes. Adjusts form inputs accordingly.
- **authSubmitHandler**: Handles form submission. Logs in the user by calling the `login` method from `AuthContext`.

#### Form Structure
- **Conditionally Rendered Input**: Renders the name input field only in signup mode.
- **Form Validation**: Uses validators to ensure input validity before enabling the submit button.

### JSX Structure
- **Card Component**: Wraps the entire form for styling purposes.
- **Form Elements**: Uses `Input` components for email, password, and conditionally for name.
- **Button Components**: Submit button for form submission and another button to switch between login and signup modes.

### Example Usage
The `Auth` component is used to handle user authentication in the application. It can be accessed via routing and will display the appropriate form based on the authentication mode.

### Special Considerations
- **Form Validation**: Uses custom validators to ensure email format and minimum password length.
- **Authentication State**: Utilizes context to manage and propagate authentication state throughout the application.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS styles ensure the form is responsive and looks good on various devices.

### Dependencies
- React library
- Custom UI components (`Card`, `Input`, `Button`)
- Custom hooks (`useForm`)
- Utility functions (`validators`)
- Context API (`AuthContext`)

### Future Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Implement better error handling for form submission (e.g., display error messages from server).
- **Loading State**: Add loading indicators during form submission.
- **Enhanced Validation**: Incorporate more comprehensive validation rules (e.g., password strength).
