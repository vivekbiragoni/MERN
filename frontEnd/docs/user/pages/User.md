### User.md

### Overview
The `User.js` file is a React component responsible for displaying a list of users. It imports and uses the `UsersList` component to render the list of users. This is a simple component that currently hardcodes a single user for display.

### Import Statements
```javascript
import React from "react";
import UsersList from "../components/UsersList";
```
- **React**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **UsersList**: A custom component that is used to render the list of users.

### Main Functionalities
- **Static User Data**: 
  - Defines a static array `USERS` containing user data.
  - Each user object includes `id`, `name`, `image`, and `places` properties.

- **Rendering UsersList**: 
  - Passes the `USERS` array to the `UsersList` component via the `item` prop.

### Component Logic
```javascript
const User = () => {
  const USERS = [
    {
      id: "u1",
      name: "Vivek",
      image: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104636857?s=400&u=c3609abd423f7ea5cd910f5d573c9bf80be3add7&v=4",
      places: 3
    },
  ];
  
  return <UsersList item={USERS} />;
};

export default User;
```

- **Static Data**: 
  - The `USERS` array contains a single user with specific properties.
  - The `image` property uses a URL pointing to a GitHub profile picture.

- **Return Statement**: 
  - The component renders the `UsersList` component, passing the `USERS` array as the `item` prop.

### Example Usage
The `User` component can be used to display a list of users in the application. As it currently stands, it only displays a single hardcoded user.

### Special Considerations
- **Static Data**: 
  - The user data is hardcoded in the component. This is suitable for initial development or testing but should be replaced with dynamic data fetched from an API or a database in a real application.

- **Image Path**: 
  - The image property uses an absolute URL for the user's profile picture. This could be adjusted to use a relative path if images are stored locally.

### Dependencies
- React library
- `UsersList` component

### Future Improvements
- **Dynamic Data**: 
  - Replace the static `USERS` array with dynamic data fetched from an external source.
  
- **Multiple Users**: 
  - Extend the component to handle and display multiple users.

- **User Management**: 
  - Implement functionality to add, edit, and delete users.
