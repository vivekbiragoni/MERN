The `getCoordsForAddress` function fetches geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for a given address using the Google Maps Geocoding API. Here's an explanation of the function:

### Explanation of `getCoordsForAddress`

1. **Imports**:
   - `HttpError`: Custom error class for throwing HTTP errors.
   - `axios`: HTTP client for making requests to external APIs.
   - `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - `API_KEY`: Retrieves the API key required to access the Google Maps Geocoding API from the environment variables.

3. **Function Definition**:
   - `getCoordsForAddress`: An asynchronous function that takes `address` as an argument and returns a promise.
   
4. **API Request**:
   - Uses `axios` to make a `GET` request to the Google Maps Geocoding API endpoint (`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json`).
   - Includes `address` and `API_KEY` as parameters in the request.

5. **Handling API Response**:
   - Upon receiving a response, checks if the response data (`data`) is valid and not empty.
   - Checks if the API response status is `"ZERO_RESULTS"`, indicating no geocoding results found for the given address.
   - If no valid data or zero results are found, throws an `HttpError` with a 404 status and a relevant error message.

6. **Extracting Coordinates**:
   - If valid data is received, extracts the geographic coordinates (`geometry.location`) from the first result (`data.results[0]`).

7. **Return**:
   - Returns the extracted coordinates as an object `{ lat: ..., lng: ... }`.

In this function:
- `axios.get()` makes an asynchronous HTTP GET request to the Google Maps Geocoding API with the provided `address` and `API_KEY`.
- It checks if the response contains valid data and handles cases where no results are found by throwing a `HttpError`.
- It extracts and returns the coordinates from the API response for further processing in other parts of the application, such as creating or updating place information with precise geographic locations based on addresses.
