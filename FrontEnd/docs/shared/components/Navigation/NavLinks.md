### NavLinks.md

### Overview
The `NavLinks.js` file defines a navigation component that conditionally renders navigation links based on the authentication state of the user.

### Import Statements
```javascript
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { NavLink } from "react-router-dom";
import "./NavLinks.css";
import { AuthContext } from "../../context/auth-context";
```
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **useContext**: React hook for accessing the context API.
- **NavLink**: React Router component for navigation links.
- **CSS**: Styles specific to the `NavLinks` component.
- **AuthContext**: Custom context to manage authentication state.

### Main Functionalities
- **Conditional Navigation Links**: Based on the user's authentication state, different navigation links are displayed.
- **Logout Functionality**: Provides a logout button that triggers the logout function from the `AuthContext`.

### Component Structure
- **Auth Context**: Uses `useContext` to access authentication state and functions from `AuthContext`.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Renders different links based on whether the user is logged in or not.

### JSX Structure
- **Navigation Links**: Wrapped in a `<ul>` element with the class `nav-links`.
- **NavLink Components**: Used for navigation with `to` prop specifying the target route.
- **Conditional Logic**: Determines which links to render based on `auth.isLoggedIn`.

### Example Usage
The `NavLinks` component is used within navigation headers or sidebars to provide user-specific navigation options.

### Special Considerations
- **Context Dependency**: Relies on `AuthContext` to determine the user's authentication state and provide login/logout functionality.

### Flow in the Larger Project
- **Navigation Management**: `NavLinks` plays a crucial role in managing navigation within the app, providing different links based on user state.
- **User Experience**: Enhances user experience by showing relevant links only when the user is logged in.

### Dependencies
- React library
- React Router for navigation
- Custom authentication context (`AuthContext`)
- CSS for styling (`NavLinks.css`)

### Future Improvements
- **Dynamic Links**: Consider fetching and rendering dynamic links based on user roles or permissions.
- **Responsive Design**: Improve the component to handle different screen sizes and layouts effectively.
- **Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility by adding ARIA roles and properties.
