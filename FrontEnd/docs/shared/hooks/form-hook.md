### Explanation of `useForm` Hook

The `useForm` hook is a custom React hook designed to manage form state and handle user inputs efficiently. It utilizes `useReducer` and `useCallback` hooks for state management and performance optimization.

#### 1. `formReducer` Function

The `formReducer` function handles state transitions based on dispatched actions. It maintains the following functionalities:

- **INPUT_CHANGE**: Updates the state when an input value changes. It validates each input based on provided validators and determines overall form validity.
  - **Inputs**: An object containing input IDs mapped to their respective values and validity.
  - **isValid**: A boolean indicating whether the entire form is currently valid.

- **SET_DATA**: Sets initial form data and validity when needed, such as when initializing or resetting the form.
  - **inputs**: Object containing initial input values and validity states.
  - **isValid**: Boolean indicating initial form validity.

#### 2. `useForm` Hook Implementation

The `useForm` hook initializes the form state using `useReducer` with the `formReducer` function defined above. It returns an array containing:

- **formState**: The current state of the form, including `inputs` and `isValid`.
- **inputHandler**: A memoized function (`useCallback`) to handle input changes.
  - **Parameters**: `id` (input ID), `value` (input value), `isValid` (validity status).
  - **Action Dispatched**: Triggers an `INPUT_CHANGE` action to update the form state based on the provided parameters.

- **setFormData**: A memoized function (`useCallback`) to set form data.
  - **Parameters**: `inputData` (initial input values), `formValidity` (initial form validity).
  - **Action Dispatched**: Triggers a `SET_DATA` action to set the initial form state based on the provided data.

#### Usage in `NewPlace` Component:

In the `NewPlace` component (not shown in detail here), `useForm` is used to manage the state of the form for adding new places. It facilitates:

- Initializing form inputs (`title`, `description`, `address`) with initial values and validity states.
- Handling user input changes (`inputHandler`).
- Setting and updating form data (`setFormData`).

#### Benefits:

- **State Management**: Centralized management of form state using React's built-in hooks (`useReducer`).
- **Performance**: Optimization through `useCallback` to memoize functions (`inputHandler`, `setFormData`) and prevent unnecessary renders.
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to accommodate additional form inputs or validation requirements in a structured manner.

This hook enhances maintainability and reusability within your React application by encapsulating form handling logic into a concise and reusable component.
