### PlaceList Component Overview

The `PlaceList` component is responsible for rendering a list of places, either displaying the list of places or prompting the user to create a new place if none are found.

#### Key Functionalities:

1. **Conditional Rendering:**
   - Checks if `props.items` (array of places) has no items (`props.items.length === 0`). If true, it renders a message suggesting the user create a new place.
   - Uses a `Button` component from `../../shared/components/FormElements/Button` to link to `/places/new` for creating a new place.

2. **Rendering Places:**
   - If `props.items` contains places, maps through each place (`props.items.map((place) => ...`).
   - Renders a `PlaceItem` component for each place, passing down props such as `key`, `id`, `image`, `title`, `description`, `address`, `creator`, and `coordinates`.

3. **Components Used:**
   - **Card Component (`Card`):** Wraps the message "No Places Found, Maybe create one?" and the "Share Place" button when no places are available.
   - **Button Component (`Button`):** Provides a button labeled "Share Place" with a link (`to="/places/new"`) to create a new place.
   - **PlaceItem Component (`PlaceItem`):** Renders each individual place's details (`image`, `title`, `description`, `address`, `creator`, `coordinates`).

4. **Styling:**
   - Applies CSS styles defined in `PlaceList.css` to structure and style the list of places (`place-list` and `center` classes).

### How It Fits in Your Project:

- **Purpose:** Displays a list of places or encourages the user to create a new place if none are available.
- **Integration:** Uses reusable components (`Card`, `Button`, `PlaceItem`) to maintain consistency and modularity in your application.
- **User Interaction:** Provides clear calls to action (`Share Place` button) for users to interact and navigate to create new places.
- **Feedback:** Offers feedback to users with a friendly message and a prompt to take action when no places are found.

This component enhances user experience by efficiently managing the display of places and encouraging user engagement through intuitive UI elements and clear messaging.
